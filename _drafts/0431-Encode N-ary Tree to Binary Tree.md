### [431. Encode N-ary Tree to Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-n-ary-tree-to-binary-tree)

#### Tags: 'Tree'

<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Design an algorithm to encode an N-ary tree into a binary tree and decode the binary tree to get the original N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. Similarly, a binary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than 2 children. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be encoded to a binary tree and this binary tree can be decoded to the original N-nary tree structure.</p>
<p>For example, you may encode the following <code>3-ary</code> tree to a binary tree in this way:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Note that the above is just an example which <em>might or might not</em> work. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><code>N</code> is in the range of <code> [1, 1000]</code></li>
<li>Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your encode and decode algorithms should be stateless.</li>
</ol>

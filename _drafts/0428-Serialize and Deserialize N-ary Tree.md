<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>
<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize an N-ary tree. An N-ary tree is a rooted tree in which each node has no more than N children. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that an N-ary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>
<p>For example, you may serialize the following <code>3-ary</code> tree</p>

<p> </p>
<p>as <code>[1 [3[5 6] 2 4]]</code>. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><code>N</code> is in the range of <code> [1, 1000]</code></li>
<li>Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.</li>
</ol>
